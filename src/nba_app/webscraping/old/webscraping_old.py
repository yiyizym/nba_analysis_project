"""
webscraping.py

This module scrapes the NBA.com website for data/statistics from previous games, and it 
finds the team ids and game ids for games scheduled today.

Selenium does all the heavy lifting in this module. Selenium is required because the data is dynamic and requires javascript to load.

(If running from GitHub Actions or other public servers, a proxy service may be required to avoid being blocked by nba.com.)

This module saves this freshly scraped data to csv files in a specific data directory for later processing. The main
purpose is to simply get the data from the website and save the fairly raw data to a convenient location for later processing.
Data manipulation and cleaning is minimal in this module, but after the csv files are saved, it does check for nulls and
that the data is consistent across the different csv files (e.g. same games in each file, same number of rows) to make sure the scraping went well.

Because of the way the data is structured on nba.com, the data is scraped in chunks based on:
    type of stats ('traditional', 'advanced', 'four-factors', 'misc', 'scoring,)
    season, 
    sub-season (regular season, play-in, playoffs), 
    and date range.

The search function on nba.com requires each of these be specified, and the data is served on different pages for each of these.

(For example, the traditional stats for the 2021 regular season are on a different page than the traditional stats for the 2021 playoffs when
using the search function on nba.com.)

The data from different seasons, sub-seasons, and date ranges, while retrieved in chunks, all have the same columns for each stat type and 
are combined (concatenated) into a single DataFrame for each type of stats.

The different stat pages (traditional, advanced, etc..) all have different columns, so the data is saved to separate csv files for each type of stats,
and the merging of the data into one single big table will be done later.

The data is saved to multiple csv files (depending on the of type stat page it came from) that will be joined later.
    games_traditional.csv, 
    games_advanced.csv
    games_four-factors.csv, 
    games_misc.csv, 
    games_scoring.csv

We also need to scrape the matchups for games scheduled today, so we can predict the winner before the game is played.
The boxscores pages are not available until after the game is played, so we have to create our own records of the games scheduled for today:
    go to the schedule page, 
    retrieve the team ids for each matchup, 
    retrieve the game ids for each game,
    and save these to csv files:

    todays_matchups.csv
    todays_game_ids.csv
    
This will enable us to later construct records of the games that are scheduled for today into our feature store/database, and then 
classify these games as wins or losses.

    
** These are all basically temporary raw data files that will be processed further in other modules. **
