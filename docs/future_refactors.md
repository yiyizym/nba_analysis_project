## Core Framework - Application Logger

### Issue: Leaky Traceback Handling

**Current State:**
Every module that uses the logger must:
1. Import `traceback` module
2. Manually call `traceback.format_exc()`
3. Pass it as a kwarg to `structured_log()`

**Example of current pattern:**
```python
import traceback  # Required in every file

try:
    # ... code
except Exception as e:
    self.app_logger.structured_log(
        logging.ERROR,
        "Operation failed",
        error=str(e),
        traceback=traceback.format_exc()  # Manual traceback capture
    )
```

**Problem:**
- Violates DRY principle - traceback capture repeated in every error handler
- Forces consumers to know implementation details
- Easy to forget, leading to inconsistent error logging

**Proposed Solution:**
Add automatic traceback capture to the logger:

```python
# In base_app_logger.py and app_logger.py
def structured_log(self, level: int, message: str, include_traceback: bool = False, **kwargs) -> None:
    """
    Log a structured message with additional context

    Args:
        level: Logging level (e.g., logging.INFO)
        message: Log message
        include_traceback: If True, automatically capture and include current traceback
        **kwargs: Additional context to include in log
    """
    if include_traceback:
        import traceback
        kwargs['traceback'] = traceback.format_exc()

    # ... rest of logging implementation
```

**Updated usage pattern:**
```python
# No traceback import needed

try:
    # ... code
except Exception as e:
    self.app_logger.structured_log(
        logging.ERROR,
        "Operation failed",
        include_traceback=True,  # Automatic traceback capture
        error=str(e)
    )
```

**Benefits:**
- Single responsibility - logger handles all logging concerns
- Consistent traceback formatting
- Less boilerplate in consumer code
- Traceback import encapsulated within logger

## Core Framework - Logging Level Constants

### Issue: Tight Coupling to Python's Logging Module

**Current State:**
All modules must import Python's `logging` module to access level constants:

```python
import logging

self.app_logger.structured_log(logging.INFO, "Message")
self.app_logger.structured_log(logging.ERROR, "Error")
```

**Problem:**
- Leaky abstraction - consumers need to know about Python's logging module
- Tightly couples all code to standard library implementation
- The `BaseAppLogger` abstraction is incomplete

**Proposed Solution (Optional):**
Expose logging levels through the logger itself:

```python
# In base_app_logger.py
class BaseAppLogger(ABC):
    # Expose logging levels as class attributes
    DEBUG = logging.DEBUG
    INFO = logging.INFO
    WARNING = logging.WARNING
    ERROR = logging.ERROR
    CRITICAL = logging.CRITICAL

    # ... rest of class
```

**Updated usage pattern:**
```python
# Could use either:
self.app_logger.structured_log(self.app_logger.INFO, "Message")

# Or if we want to be more opinionated:
# Don't import logging at all, use logger constants
```

**Counterargument:**
The current approach using `logging.INFO` etc. is:
- Standard Python practice
- Well understood by all Python developers
- Not worth changing unless we want to completely abstract away Python's logging

**Recommendation:**
Keep the current approach with `logging` constants - this is actually good design for a Python-specific framework. The constants are part of Python's standard interface.

**Status:** LOW PRIORITY - Current design is acceptable

## Summary

### High Priority
- **Traceback Handling**: Encapsulate within logger to reduce boilerplate and improve consistency

### Low Priority
- **Logging Constants**: Current design is acceptable, no change needed

## Logging Improvements - Contextual Information
### Issue: Lack of Contextual Information in Logs
**Current State:**
Logs have changed and need to figure out why and fix this:

## Conformal prediction
- add optimization for alpha and empirical coverage
- add visualization of empirical coverage vs alpha
- make sure stored in MLflow artifacts
- test set to make sure conformal prediction is working as expected
